## IMPROVEMENTS / TO DO

- Merge functions ,there are too much wich are similar or equal... to share functions between components
- When create item, to add a new brand: open a modal to create it. ALSO WITH CATEGORIES... and display selected ones
- (img)placeholder for items with no img // or add option property like : publish = true/false
- Add breadcrumbs (visual route links) https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/components/breadcrumb/
- If you go out from creating new item without uploading an image, get an alert
- At createitem,when choose main category,should only displays related categories
- Change the filter query for an array : `${process.env.React_APP_SERVER}items?${filterQuery}`
