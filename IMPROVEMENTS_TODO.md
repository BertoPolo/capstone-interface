## IMPROVEMENTS / TO DO / NICE TO HAVE

- Merge functions ,there are too much wich are similar or equal... to share functions between components
- (img)placeholder for items with no img // or add option property like : publish = true/false
- Add breadcrumbs (visual route links) https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/components/breadcrumb/
- If you go out from creating new item without uploading an image, get an alert
- At createitem, when choose main category,should only displays related categories
- Change the filter query for an array : `${process.env.React_APP_SERVER}items?${filterQuery}`
- Improve pages changing/navigation. removing functions setting just where you are, without true/false. Do a dictionary with routes,
- URL routes ( single Item done)
- Avoid repeating route elements
- Responsive Card payment
- Styling problem with new spinners Login,createUser => put the spinner in a emergent window?
- Add "token required" to swagger and finish it
- BackEnd - don't send all filtered items if not asking
- SECURITY!!
- Use user's bike to tell if it fits on user's bike
- Show some graphs in the backoffice about sales or whatever you want => https://nivo.rocks/line/
- Create discount vouchers
- Link Cart with token/user
- Spinner --- let a red light if something went wrong and setTimeout to remove it ( only done in Login )
- Redo Login without duplicating code ( about responsiveness )
- Filters, change how are working
