- merge functions ,there are too much wich are similar or equal... to share functions between components
- when create item, to add a new brand: open a modal to create it. ALSO WITH CATEGORIES... and display selected ones
- (img)placeholder for items with no img // or add option propertie like : publish = true/false
- add breadcrumbs (visual route links) https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/components/breadcrumb/
- if you go out from creating new item without uploading an image, get an alert
